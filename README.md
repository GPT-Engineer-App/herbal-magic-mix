# herbal-magic-mix

Letâ€™s work together to create a mobile web app named hierberito moderno. Where we use plants ethnobotany, all families of plants to suggest a remedy to aid the body heal. Okay, let's start by refining the purpose and the interface. I want it to be like on the main header, just like a little search bar where you ask the user to input what they want to get as a result from the usage of the plan. I want the search to look up for all possible remedies or mixes of plans that we can use through a wholesale at the back end, that I can feed it all the available things that I have for sale, and it will pick everything that will be able to help and assist and give it a mixture and customize it to the user. That will be the main search bar, and that will be the result. On the bottom will be different things like roots, powders, flowers, or different things with ethnobotany that you can buy, also, again, from that wholesale at the back end. Very cool, very simple, but modern and very friendly user. They look good. They look good, my friend. All right, well, I would just change the color. I would like to change the color to be like an earthy, moonlit application, you know? And I want to include mushrooms. I want to include leaves and mushrooms. Theme should be 1 more think beautiful midnight moon light magical tropical rain forest
